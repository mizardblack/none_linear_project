        <h3>Self as System</h3>
        <p>This is a piece that uses a dataset to explore the notion of a “self.” I started with personal data
            downloaded from Instagram. Basing on the downloaded data, I created a set of 5 online web sketches in 5 days
            that function as reflections, interventions, and expansions in the notion of self, using the online
            protocols including webpages, Google map, and Splice. Eventually I integrated them to create a systems-based
            self portrait.</p>

        <p>In the final project, I bring up the philosophy questions about self in order to start the conversation: a
            study on myself via social media data. One of the very interesting things is that the digital version of me
            was both so real and so hypocritical at the same time. The data reveals my historical geolocations, my
            interests, even my fake laughter. On the other hand, the data wasn't able to reflect that I'm a shy person,
            that I'm enthusiastic about the people I care about but I pretend to be indifferent. The data doesn't answer
            my question about the future neither. There are things that the data shows and doesn't, and I am digging out
            the answer about self though this project.</p>
